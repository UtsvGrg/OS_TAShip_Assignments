I have written a small kernel module, which implements a kernel system call as a module. 
The task of the system call is to read the entries of the process task_struct corresponding to any
given process (supplied as input via command line argument) and prints the
values of the following field: pid, user id, process group id (pgid) and command
path. It is functional only when the module is loaded, not otherwise

I have used module_param to take input through the command line argument
and have gotton the task_struct pointer using find_get_pid and get_pid_task
Once you have the task struct, all you have to do is the specific material using
pointer to the task, comm, pid and uid

To run the command
1) make
2) sudo insmod hello.ko param_num=3
3) sudo dmesg
4) sudo rmmod hello.ko
