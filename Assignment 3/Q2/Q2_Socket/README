I have written two programs P1 and P2. The first program P1 generates an
array of 50 random strings (of characters) of fixed length each. P1 then sends
a group of five consecutive elements of the array of strings to P2 along with
the ID’s of the strings, where the ID is the index of the array corresponding
to the string. The second program P2 needs to accept the received strings,
and send back the highest ID received back to P1 to acknowledge the strings
received. The program P2 simply prints the ID’s and the strings on the console.
On receiving the acknowledged packet, P1 sends the next five strings, with the
string elements starting from the successor of the acknowledged ID.

Here in this part I have used the socket, approach, sockets being bi-directional
we need one to facilitate communication between the two process. I have created 
a socket using socket() and subsequently for the server side have created bind,
listen and accept functions for its presence in the unix domain using AF_UNIX

Synchoronization is maintained as sockets used byte stream approach
therefore does not find any error of such sort. Also, the sockets's can be found
using name of the sockets and its relative address.
