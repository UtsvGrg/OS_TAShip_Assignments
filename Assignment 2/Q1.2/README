This code is written to teach linux processes and thier scheduling

The file schedule_test.c has three forking functions, which run three forks
with each different scheduling policy SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR

We use fork() and execl() to run the bash file and compile the kernel with the
given rev-config-9-gold. We run and compile the process three times with different
policy and store the time taken inside the f1.txt 

Now the data stored in the f1.txt is plotted on a bar graph using python numpy 
and matplotlib, which is run by the c program by using fork and running bash file using 
the system() command.

The output let us know that, the fastest scheduling occurs for the FIFO, after which RR 
and finally, Other. 

The plotting of the bar graph takes the y-axis as time taken by the different process
